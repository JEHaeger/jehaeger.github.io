<h3 id="A-little-about-Joe"><a href="#A-little-about-Joe" class="headerlink" title="A little about Joe"></a>A little about Joe</h3><p>Joseph Edwin Haeger is the author of the experimental memoir <em>Learn to Swim</em> (University of Hell Press), the brisk crime novella <em>Bardo</em> (Thirty West Publishing House), and the speculative novel <em>Strings</em> (Anxiety Press). He writes fiction, essays, poetry, and screenplays. As a litmus test, he tells people his favorite movie is <em>Face/Off</em>, but there’s a part of him that’s afraid it’s true. </p>
<p>He lives in the Inland PNW.</p>

<p><em>“This literary work offers more than just speculative fiction—it provides a raw glimpse into the essence of parenthood and the existential dread of shaping another human life.”</em> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://independentbookreview.com/2024/10/29/starred-book-review-strings-by-joseph-edwin-haeger/">(Independent Book Review <em>STRINGS</em> STARRED REVIEW)</a></p>
<p><em>“The little details he gives the characters that make them feel so human, so relatable, and often so flawed—just like we all are.”</em> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://triyou.com/f/strings-by-joseph-edwin-haeger">(TriYou <em>STRINGS</em> REVIEW)</a></p>
<p><em>“The scope, with its multiple points of view, its timeline that skips through an entire lifetime, and its emotional depth, seems impossibly large for only 90 pages, but, somehow, Haeger packs in enough questions and considerations to leave the reader contemplating the story for hours, maybe days after reading.”</em> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://independentbookreview.com/2023/10/03/starred-book-review-bardo/">(Independent Book Review <em>BARDO</em> STARRED REVIEW)</a></p>
<p>“Bardo <em>has no bullshit.

<p><em>“Like his novella-length memoir</em> Learn to Swim, <em>the prose in</em> Bardo <em>is unencumbered by paragraphs and, for the most part, avoids the use of proper names. But in this outing, Haeger’s chapter numbering takes readers on unexpected twists and turns.</em> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.spokesman.com/stories/2023/nov/26/joseph-edwin-haegers-bardo-tackles-violence-vengea/">(The Spokesman-Review <em>BARDO</em> WRITE UP)</a></p>
