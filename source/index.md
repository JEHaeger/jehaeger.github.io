### A little about Joe
Joseph Edwin Haeger is the author of the experimental memoir *Learn to Swim* (University of Hell Press), the brisk crime novella *Bardo* (Thirty West Publishing House), and the speculative novel *Strings* (Anxiety Press). He writes fiction, essays, poetry, and screenplays. As a litmus test, he tells people his favorite movie is *Face/Off*, but there's a part of him that's afraid it's true. 

He lives in the Inland PNW.

### Press
Joseph talks about friendship, those who influence us, and the value of being called out on Tyler Dempsey's fantastic podcast. [(Another Fucking Writing Podcast)](https://tylerdempseywriting.com/another-fucking-writing-podcast/)

*"This literary work offers more than just speculative fiction—it provides a raw glimpse into the essence of parenthood and the existential dread of shaping another human life."* [(Independent Book Review *STRINGS* STARRED REVIEW)](https://independentbookreview.com/2024/10/29/starred-book-review-strings-by-joseph-edwin-haeger/)

*"The little details he gives the characters that make them feel so human, so relatable, and often so flawed—just like we all are."* [(TriYou *STRINGS* REVIEW)](https://triyou.com/f/strings-by-joseph-edwin-haeger)

*"The scope, with its multiple points of view, its timeline that skips through an entire lifetime, and its emotional depth, seems impossibly large for only 90 pages, but, somehow, Haeger packs in enough questions and considerations to leave the reader contemplating the story for hours, maybe days after reading."* [(Independent Book Review *BARDO* STARRED REVIEW)](https://independentbookreview.com/2023/10/03/starred-book-review-bardo/)

"Bardo *has no bullshit. It builds suspense masterfully and I honestly couldn't put it down."* [(TriYou *BARDO* REVIEW)](https://triyou.com/f/bardo-by-joseph-edwin-haeger?fbclid=PAZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAAaap1OVSF8ZGmHUcn7gNVUg8lM-C_pGDF21JbL0_B7kMsohTV2Mn_9Zwens_aem_ZmFrZWR1bW15MTZieXRlcw)

*"Like his novella-length memoir* Learn to Swim, *the prose in* Bardo *is unencumbered by paragraphs and, for the most part, avoids the use of proper names. But in this outing, Haeger's chapter numbering takes readers on unexpected twists and turns.* [(The Spokesman-Review *BARDO* WRITE UP)](https://www.spokesman.com/stories/2023/nov/26/joseph-edwin-haegers-bardo-tackles-violence-vengea/)

*"*[Learn to Swim] *eschews that stereotype and allows for an honest exploration of a friendship of young boys who work well together and know it."* 
[(Independent Book Review *LEARN TO SWIM* STARRED REVIEW)](https://independentbookreview.com/2019/05/07/book-review-learn-to-swim/)

*"The complexity and originality here is on full display from the beginning. Told in snippets from Year One onward, you are dropped into a story you have to tell for yourself at first."* 
[(Drunk in a Midnight Choir *LEARN TO SWIM* REVIEW)](https://drunkinamidnightchoir.wordpress.com/2016/04/20/review-learn-to-swim-by-joseph-edwin-haeger/)
