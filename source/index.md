### A little about Joe
Joseph Edwin Haeger is the author of the experimental memoir *Learn to Swim* (University of Hell Press, 2015). He writes fiction, essays, poetry, and screenplays. As a litmus test, he tells people his favorite movie is *Face/Off*, but there's a part of him that's afraid it's true. 

He lives in the Inland PNW.

### Press
*"*[Learn to Swim] *eschews that stereotype and allows for an honest exploration of a friendship of young boys who work well together and know it."* 
[(Independent Book Review)](https://independentbookreview.com/2019/05/07/book-review-learn-to-swim/)

*"The complexity and originality here is on full display from the beginning. Told in snippets from Year One onward, you are dropped into a story you have to tell for yourself at first."* 
[(Drunk in a Midnight Choir)](https://drunkinamidnightchoir.wordpress.com/2016/04/20/review-learn-to-swim-by-joseph-edwin-haeger/)
